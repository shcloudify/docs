## Simple Search

This feature is used to match products between HubSpot and e-conomic by correlating a specific field, such as SKU or product number. It's particularly useful for users who have long product lists. Choose the corresponding field in HubSpot and e-conomic for automatic identification from the respective dropdowns.

</Frame>

### Direct Link

You can connect products directly without searching. This option is useful for users who have short product lists. Map the Hubspot fields with the e-conomic fields and click **"Save Mappings".**

## Advance Settings

This option is useful when a product is not found in the search. It offers three options, which are:

**Skip Invoice Generation:** Select this option if you prefer not to create an invoice when a product isn't found in e-conomic.

\*\*Use a Default Product: \*\*When a product is not found in the e-conomic, it will use a default product from the e-conomic for generating the invoice. If you select this option, you must specify a default product from your e-conomic product list.

**Create a new product in e-conomic**: This option is for automatically generating a new product entry in e-conomic when a matching item isn't found, using product details from HubSpot. You must specify the product group to ensure the new product aligns with the correct category in e-conomic. Select the product group and click "**Finish**".

### **Sync deals which do not have products associated with them**

This option is applicable when there are no products in a deal, and the user wants to sync the deal. You can check this option. Select the product and click "**Finish**".
