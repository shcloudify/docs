title: "Customer Search Rules"
description: "Set up Customer Search Rules to seamlessly synchronize customer information between HubSpot and e-conomic, ensuring data consistency and avoiding duplicate entries. The integration actively searches for customers based on your defined parameters; if a match is found, that record is used; otherwise, a new customer profile is created to maintain a comprehensive database."

### **Company Matching Criteria**

From the first drop-down menu, select the HubSpot field that matches the chosen e-conomic field. Then, select a unique field to identify existing customers in e-conomic from the second drop-down menu. This ensures that both platforms refer to the same customer attribute when data is shared between the systems, thus maintaining consistency
